Report: Big Data Analytics Project Workflow
1. Project Overview

This report details the structure of the BigDataAnalytics project hosted on GitHub. The project is organized as a series of data analysis tasks implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, primarily using PySpark for big data operations.

Repository Details:

Name: BigDataAnalytics

Language: Jupyter Notebook (100.0%)

Description: A step-by-step big data analytics workflow using PySpark.

Activity: The repository has 0 stars, 0 watchers, and 0 forks.

Releases/Packages: No releases or packages have been published.

2. Inferred Analysis Workflow

The project’s structure is laid out in a series of numbered steps, from initial data transformation to a final mini-project. This reflects a step-by-step approach to learning and applying data analysis techniques.

Data Transformation Using PySpark RDD: The process begins with transformations on PySpark’s Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) for cleaning, structuring, and preparing data.

Collect() Operation with RDD: Demonstrates how to retrieve results from distributed RDDs to the driver node for inspection.

Sample() and TakeSample() Methods: Covers random sampling of data for testing, exploration, and working with smaller subsets.

Exploring Structure and Contents of a CSV File: Involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand schema, data types, and basic statistics.

Viewing Data and Selecting Columns of a CSV File: Narrowing analysis to relevant features by selecting and filtering specific columns.

Analytical Operations on a CSV File: Performs aggregations, filtering, and calculations to extract insights.

Formula 1 Data Analysis (Mini Project): The final step applies all techniques on a Formula 1 dataset (races, drivers, constructors, circuits, results). It includes:

Driver performance analysis (points, wins, podiums).

Constructor dominance and win rates.

Race dynamics (grid vs finish, DNFs).

Fastest lap and speed insights.

Season-wise trends and correlations.
